### Hey there Carlos here ðŸ‘‹

![My banner image with a computer screen and shurikens](./webshuriken-monitor-banner.png "My banner")

My passion for coding began when I was 10 and used MS-DOS to play a game.
Things did not go as planned so ended up in a different career. Enough is enough, now it't time to do what I love which is coding.
I want to specialise in frontend development although backend is also on the cards.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on #100 Days of Code Challenge and CS50W
- ðŸŒ± With it Im learning all I can regarding web technology, 1 technology at a time.
- ðŸ‘¯ Collaboration on here still new to me so if you have a Readme which needs updating or maybe JS bug testing let us work together.
